name: Auto-ML pipeline for regression and classification on pre-processed dataset
description: Devloping an Auto-ML pipeline is the need of an hour. The pipleine will
  save the training time of the user for all the models, making this pipeline much
  for optimal and efficient. One must upload the pre-processed dataset and based on
  the dataset whether regression or classification, the dataset will be auto-trained
  for various algorithms. The pipeline would display the report with following parameters
  such as nature of the dataset, trained model, accuracy score, hyper-parameters tuned.
