# Streamlining Machine Learning Model Development: An Auto-ML Pipeline for Regression and Classification

### Auto-ML Pipeline
The AutoML pipeline for classification and regression aims to reduce the time of the user by providing the user with the machine learning pipeline using some pre-trained models.
The user simply needs to upload the preprocessed dataset. Rest all the functionalities will be covered by the pipelining mentioned in the proposed research.
The AutoML pipeline will provide with accurate model selection and it's implementation on the dataset with the best fitting hyperparameters to improve the overall accuracy.
The AutoML pipeline will also display a detailed report after the pipelining is completed. One can also check the pipeline for a custom test case and get the prediction instantly.
The proposed AutoML pipeline can be used in various domains such as customer churn, health care, finance etc.

### Dataset
The Auto-ML Pipeline was tested on the following datasets.
#### Classification
SONAR dataset was used for testing the classification problem
